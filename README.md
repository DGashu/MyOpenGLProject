# MyOpenGLProject
## A project for learning OpenGL with GLAD and GLFW


This project was originally created because I wanted to practice my C++ skills and learn how to create and manage windows and draw stuff on that language.
OpenGL and GLFW where recommended so I wanted to learn and practice my skills
The repository was for me to learn and start using git for projects.
